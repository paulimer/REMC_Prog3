* Introduction
** Monte Carlo Algorithms
*** MC algorithm
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: definition
:END:
A Monte Carlo algorithm is a problem solving procedures that uses randomness to approach a solution too complex to solve deterministically.
** The HP protein folding model
*** HP model
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: definition
:END:
The Hydrophobic-Polar protein folding model is a highly simplified model of protein folding in space, that relies on the dominance of the /hydrophobic effect/ on soluble protein folding. It sorts amino acid in two categories, hydrophobic or polar.
** The Replica Exchange Monte Carlo
*** REMC
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_env: definition
:END:
The Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (or parallel tempering), is a type of MC algorithm. It runs parallelly multiple MC models, at different temperatures, and exchanges them based on their energy.
** The VSHD neighbourhood

*** VSHD :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: .3
:BEAMER_env: definition
:END:
A /neighbourhood/ of exploration, consisting of three moves a conformation can perform:
- an /end move/ (only for end residues)
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- /corner move/
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- /crankshaft move/
* Implementation
** Object-oriented programming
- Python 3.10 with numpy 1.22
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- 3 classes:
  - AminoAcid - A basic amino acid, attributes: ~position, hp_type, index~
  - Conformation - The main class, attributes: ~lattice, amino_list, sequence, energy, line~
  - Move - a class for movement, attributes: ~move_type, conf, number, new_position, old_position~
** The class relations
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 200px
#+CAPTION: The 3 classes implemented and their relationships
#+NAME: fig:cls
[[./classes.png]]
** Two functions and a main
- ~mc_search~: Takes a conformation, drives its evolution step by step (internal loop)
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- ~remc~: Orchestrates all the replicas, stopping either at a target energy or at a specified maximum number of steps
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- ~main.py~: Parses the arguments with ~argparse~, creates the conformation and runs the optimization
** Around the program
- Used podman - but limitation to files entry in a CLI
- Used conda for file handling

* Results
** Middling at best
- Slow algorithm: two minutes for 110 residues with 5000 total steps (with random walk initialization)
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- Buggy crankshaft moves
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- Not much movement without /pull moves/, especially with a line start position
* Discussion - Post mortem
** Bad decisions
    - The exaggerated OOP (~Move~) and deepcopy usage
  #+BEAMER: \pause
    - No reproducible examples
  #+BEAMER: \pause
    - No non-random test environment


** Knowledge limits
- Lack of knowledge about debugging in Python
  #+BEAMER: \pause
- Lack of knowledge about performance profiling in Python




** Tool limits
    - Manipulating heavy lattices is unwieldly in Python
  #+BEAMER: \pause
    - Python is a slow language, especially with low-level programs such as this

** Paper limits
*** :BMCOL:
:PROPERTIES:
:BEAMER_col: .3
:END:
- At least a mistake: a wrong comparison sign cost a lot of time
- The omission of the mention of the usage of the Boltzmann constant is also surprising
